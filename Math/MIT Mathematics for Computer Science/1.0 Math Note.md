## Math Note one

**Well ordering principle** every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a least/smallest element.

we can ask the question that what is the least number of * in a set, cause we know it's existence.



**A proposition命题** is either True or False.

a implies b or c (b and c can both be true)

a implies b xor c (b and c cannot both be true) 

if b is true and c is true then the upper proposition is false be cause we don't have this case
