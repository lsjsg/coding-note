## ROS file system
`rospack find *` (rospack find roscpp)
`roscd *` (roscd roscpp)
`rosls *` (roscpp_tutorials)

start `roscore` to start runnning the packages
`rosnode list` (show what is running on ros)
`rosnode info /rosout` (show the infomation of the nodes)

`rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node` (use ros to run the package turtlesim)
`rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key` (start the teleop key to run control the turtle)
`rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node __name:=my_turtle` (naming the node using the name you want)
`rosnode ping my_turtle` (ping the node)
`rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph` (we can see the communication between the nodes and the topics that they are communicating with)

## ROS topics

rostopic allows to get information about ros topics (need to add topic name behind)
		`rostopic bw`     display bandwidth used by topic
		`rostopic echo`   print messages to screen
		`rostopic hz`     display publishing rate of topic
		`rostopic list`   print information about active topics
		`rostopic pub`    publish data to topic
		`rostopic type`   print topic type

`rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel` (allow your to see what message is send on the ros topic)

`rostopic list -v` (list out the list of messages)

`rostopic type [topic]` (returns the message type of any topic being published)

`rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist` (let us see what are the messages we can get:the templete)

`rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[2.0,0.0,0.0]' '[0.0,0.0,1.8]'` will help publish the message to the topic

​		`rostopic pub` will publish message to a given topic

​		`-1` will cause the topic to public only one message then exit

​		`/turtle1/cmd_vel` is the name of the topic to publish

​		`geometry_msgs/Twist` is the type of message publishing to the topic

​		`--` tells the option parser that non of the following arguments are five

`rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]'` this will publish a velocity command at a rate of 1 Hz on the velocity topic

`rostopic echo /turtle1/pose` this will show the pose message that transfered on this topic

`rostopic type /turtle1/cmd_vel | rosmsg show` this shows how the format of the messages

`rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot` displays a scrolling time plot of the data published on the topics

## ROS service

`rosservice list`         print information about active services
`rosservice call`         call the service with the provided args
`rosservice type`         print service type
`rosservice find`         find services by service type
`rosservice uri`           print service ROSRPC uri

`rosservice call /clear` this clears the background of the turtlesim

`rosservice type /spawn | rossrv show` the service has arguments by looking at the information for the service spawn

`rosservice call /spawn 2 2 0.2 ""` this service let us spawn a new turtle at a given location and orientation, the name fields is optional

`rosparam set`             set parameter
`rosparam get`             get parameter
`rosparam load`           load parameters from file
`rosparam dump`           dump parameters to file
`rosparam delete`      delete parameter
`rosparam list`           list parameter names

`rosparam list` we can see the turtlesim node has three parameters on the param server for background color

`rosparam set /background_r 150`

`rosparam get /background_g` 

`rosparam get /` get the parameters

`rosparam dump params.yaml` we save the parameters into a file

`rosparam load params.yaml` copy load the parameters
